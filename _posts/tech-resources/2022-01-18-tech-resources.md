title: My Favourite Tech Resources

## The Story
Everyone's got certain websites and tools that they go back to, or certain guides and snippets of information that's really hard to find, despite being very well written. I feel that I should share some of these, so that others can benefit from them.

I will be updating this list with new resources and goodies as time goes by.
