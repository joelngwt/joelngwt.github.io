*Last updated: 28 March 2022*

I’ve played a giant bunch of Android games, and I realized that I don’t have a proper way to track or remember the good Android games that I’ve played. Even looking at my app history on the Google Play Store is now too difficult, as I have installed too many apps.

So, before my app history gets out of hand, here’s my list below. You’ll notice that there aren’t games like Clash of Clans, Candy Crush, or 2048, because I honestly don’t see what’s so good about those games. They’re all either so simple to the point that they’re boring, or just clones of games that already exist.

One important thing to note is that I’m a gamer who looks for uniqueness and progression in my games. This is what most of my recommended games will contain. At least 90% of the games on this list should be refreshing enough to get you hooked.

Some of these games are so old that they do not exist on the Play Store anymore. You could try finding them on APK websites like APKPure or similar.

Finally, this is a list that will be continuously updated when I find a good game. Access this list in the future via the game review section of this blog.

## Must Play

These are games that I believe are definite must plays for everyone. The games in this list have at least one of the following characteristics: never-before seen game mechanics on mobile (or extremely rare), satisfying game progression (so it’s not pointless to play it), or it’s an extremely well-polished game as a whole. However, these games could be a little more complex than what most mobile game users are used to, so if you are looking for something more simple, go to the last section at the end of this post.

* [Bad Piggies](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rovio.BadPiggies&amp;hl=en) (Physics based game where you build your own vehicle)
* [Royal Revolt](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.flaregames.royalrevolt) (Tower defence - except that you’re the attacker)
* [Nimble Quest](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nimblebit.nimblequest) (Snake, with a twist)
* Strikefeet Omega™ (Best real-time strategy game on mobile, with great controls)
* [Injustice: Gods Among Us](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wb.goog.injustice) (Probably the only arcade fighter game on mobile worth playing)
* [Super Stickman Golf](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.noodlecake.ssg) (Golf games were never this fun)
* Decromancer (It’s a collectible card game where the placements of your cards matter. And I’m not just talking about “oh this card is opposite that card, so this blocks that”. Nope. There’s a card battlefield, which is a 2x5 area for you to use. Then there’s ranged cards, melee cards, and cards with area of effect abilities. And there’s a pretty well-thought out story too)
* [Sorcery!](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.inkle.sorcery1&amp;hl=en) (This is the overall best game on a mobile, in my opinion. However, this game isn’t free. It’s a storybook adventure game, and it undoubtedly has one of the best stories out there on Android. The choices you make matter, and there are puzzles and combat as well.)
* [Mystic Messenger](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Cheritz.MysticMessenger&amp;hl=en) (This is an otome game [game targeted at women, usually about dating], but I think everyone should give it a shot. It’s one of a kind with its chatroom and texting system, and the story isn’t too shabby at all. In fact, the story can get a little dark and disturbing. Due to how the game progresses in real time this game will last you at least 2 months. There’s that much content.)
* (**Updated**) [Arknights](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.YoStarEN.Arknights) (This is a tower defence game where your towers (units) are obtained via a gacha system. This might be a red flag to some, but the whole game can be completed without any of the higher tier units, it's just a little more difficult to do so. Gacha rates are also far more generous than most of the other gacha games out there. What I do like about Arknights is that the tower defence gameplay is rather difficult, which is actually a deviation to most tower defence games out there. Arknights isn't a game where you just place your unit down, the wave spawns and your unit attacks, no. Timing matters, placement matters, skill usage matters, team composition matters.)

## Just Try It - Individual Tastes Differ

These games are good, but they’re not good enough to the point where I can confidently say that you’ll definitely like them. Some of them have issues with the balance of the game, or there’s the fact that they can be extremely grindy or slow-paced. Nonetheless, they’re still relatively good games, especially when compared to the garbage that is out there.

* Plight of the Zombie (straightforward puzzle game. Avoid line of sight, collect brains, that kind of thing)
* [Reaper](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.hexage.reaper) (Trial game - pay to continue. This game seems to have a solid story - something that’s scarily rare in the mobile scene. The controls are also solid for an action side-scroller game)
* The Blockheads (Best Minecraft type of game I’ve seen on mobile. Terraria doesn’t feel enough like Minecraft, and Minecraft Pocket Edition is a mess. First person games just don’t work well on mobile)
* Where’s My Water? (If you like puzzles, this is a good one)
* [Rival Knights](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftOKHM) (Ever wanted to play a game where you can joust? Well, play this. But seriously, it took 23 years before I found a jousting game. Why aren’t there more of these?)
* [Auralux](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wardrumstudios.auralux) (Another take on the real-time strategy genre. However, the strategy aspect is not very strong, and the pace of the game is extremely slow. Speed up is actually a paid unlockable)
* Colossatron (Odd game, this one. Play it to understand it)

## Try, But Not Worth Devoting Time To

These are games that can actually make it into the two lists above, if not for the way the game progresses. These games either require too much effort or time to advance adequately, or they have game mechanics that just aren’t fun after the first 10 minutes. It might also be due to non-existent progression mechanics, so there’s nothing new for you to look forward to.

* [Robotek](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.hexage.robotek.hd&amp;hl=en) (A pretty interesting strategy/RPG mix. However, as you advance through the game, the AI just cheats by tweaking the random number generator. Strategy? Lol no. Not worth playing once you get to that stage)
* Dead Ahead (A fun 2D zombie shooter. You need to grind a lot to afford the weapons and upgrades)
* [Plague Inc.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.miniclip.plagueinc) (Trial version. Want to wipe out mankind with bio-weapons? Play this. Not much replayability in the free trial, but reviews are good)
* [Undead Slayer Extreme SEA](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nhnsg.undeadslayer) (A great way to port the idea of Dynasty Warriors onto the mobile platform. However, it’s a very difficult game to play, and things are expensive)
* GUN BROS 2 (It’s also like Dynasty Warriors, but this one is with guns. Things are also expensive in this game, so be prepared to work for stuff)
* [Rapture - World Conquest](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tundragames.rapture_worldconquest&amp;hl=en) (This is a pretty well made RTS game on mobile, and it feels quite a lot like Risk. However, there’s no progression at all, and the money you earn is only useful for changing the map, and your nation, which has no effect on gameplay. Simply put, after the first 15 minutes, you’ve played all the game has to offer.)

## Lots Of Time Needed (RPG-ish)

These are games that require a large investment of your time (or money). This basically means that the games here are grindy in nature. On the bright side, these are the type of games that will last a very long time, as they usually feature lots of ways for you to build up your team or weapons, enhancing them and being the very best. They will also possibly give you some long terms goals and achievements to work towards.

* [Crusaders Quest](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nhnent.SKQUEST) (Unique and simple combat system, where blocks periodically appear to collect in a row. Use those blocks to attack. It features a hero collection and hero evolving system.)
* [Brave Frontier](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=sg.gumi.bravefrontier) (Grindy game. However, gameplay is solid. If you like JRPGs, this should be up your alley)
* [Slingshot Braves](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.colopl.enslingshot) (The combat mechanics in this game is extremely unique. You fight using a slingshot/billiards system.)
* Dungeon Link (You have a team of heroes on a board, the board has start and end points on them. You have to link these points together to move your heroes to attack. You can collect and evolve heroes. What I really like is that you can set the game to play by itself, which is great since I don’t need to spend hours actively playing it)

## Awesome Simplicity - Also Must Plays

These games are just straight up simple. There’s no complexity in the rules or mechanics of the game, but the game still manages to be very exciting and fun.

* [Can Knockdown 3](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pl.idreams.CanKnockdown3) (You knock cans down with a ball. What’s not to like?)
* [Airport Scanner](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pgpublish.android.airportscanner) (You have a queue at an airport. Scan their luggage correctly, and clear the queue)
* [CSR Racing](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.naturalmotion.csrracing) (Play a racing game with just one finger)
* [Smash Hit](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mediocre.smashhit) (You throw balls at targets as you move through the level. This is a really good game, in my opinion)
* [Magic Touch: Wizard for Hire](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nitrome.magictouch) (Patterns fall from the sky. Draw the patterns before they reach the ground)
* [AdVenture Capitalist](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kongregate.mobile.adventurecapitalist.google) (Another one of those automatic games. I like this one though. It has a comfortable level of complexity and interaction while still being automatic. Also, the soundtrack will get stuck in your head)
* The Quest Keeper (Swipe to move through a level riddled with traps. Pretty cool game)
